## Scope of v0.1

v0.1 is deliberately feature-sparse. It exists to prove the core idea (below): **when everything is immutable, every proven fact stays true**, so correctness checks are cheap, local, and permanent. Anything that doesn't serve that idea waits.

## The core idea: immutable values, growing knowledge

**Values never change, but what we know about them only grows, and that knowledge is part of their type.**

When code discovers a property of a value (by a guard, a `match`, a boundary check, or a function's promised result), the property becomes part of that value's type from that point on, as the value is passed forward into other functions, records, and collections. (The compiler derives these facts lazily, only where something needs them; see below.)

```
fn handle(raw: Int, name: Option[String]): Result[Receipt, HandleError] = {
  // raw: Int
  if !positive(raw) { return Err(NotPositive) }
  // raw: Int where positive

  match name {
    Some(n) => greet(n)     // n: String
    None    => greetAnon()
  }

  transfer(raw)             // transfer needs Int where positive, and raw has it
}
```

What follows from this:

- **One mechanism, many sources.** Checking an `Option`, an `if` guard, a `match`, a boundary `prove`, an inference rule, and a function's postcondition all do the same thing: add a fact to a type. The statically checked `Option` is simply the most common case.
- **Immutability is what makes it sound.** A fact about an immutable value can never become false, so facts are only ever added, never invalidated. There is no need to track writes or aliasing.
- **More facts means a more specific type.** `Int where positive` can be used anywhere an `Int` is expected. Because nothing is mutable, `List[Int where positive]` is also safely usable as a `List[Int]`.
- **Facts flow through generics.** Passing `x: Int where positive` through `identity[T]` keeps the fact, because `T` is `Int where positive`.
- **Facts live inside data.** Once `user.age` is known to satisfy `adult`, that is part of `user`'s type for as long as `user` exists.
- **Branches merge by intersection.** After an `if`/`else`, only the facts that hold on every path remain.
- **Zero runtime cost.** Facts are erased when compiling to Go. At runtime, `Int where positive` is just an `int`.

### Facts are derived lazily, on demand

Facts exist only at compile time, and are never computed unless something needs them. The compiler does not carry every known fact forward. It works backwards from requirements:

1. **Compile without constraints.** Ordinary type checking first, ignoring all `where` clauses.
2. **Collect obligations at the leaves.** Every call to a function with a constrained parameter (or construction of a constrained record) creates an obligation, e.g. "at this call site, `amount` must be `positive`".
3. **Resolve each obligation backwards** from its call site, through guards, `match`es, bindings, and promised results, until the fact is found (a guard, a literal, a boundary check, a declared result, an inference rule) or it is clear that it cannot be.
4. **Nothing else is derived.** Facts no one asks for are never computed.

This also settles facts about several values (`start <= end`). Such a fact is only ever asked for where some callee requires it, and resolved from there. A value that goes on alone, without the other, causes no trouble, because nothing asks about the relation.

### Callers prove or declare

When an obligation's backward search reaches one of the calling function's own parameters, the caller must do one of two things:

- **Prove it**, with a guard, a `match`, a boundary check, and so on, before the call; or
- **Declare the same requirement** on its own parameter, which passes the obligation on to *its* callers.

There are **no inferred preconditions.** A requirement never climbs silently from a callee to its callers. Every function's requirements are written in its signature, so signatures stay complete and trustworthy, packages compile on their own, and recursion needs no special handling.

```
fn transfer(amount: Money where positive) = ...

fn payOut(amount: Money) = {
  transfer(amount)              // build error: positive not proven
}

fn payOutChecked(amount: Money) = {
  if positive(amount) { transfer(amount) }   // proven here
}

fn payOutDeclared(amount: Money where positive) = {
  transfer(amount)              // declared: payOutDeclared's callers must prove it
}
```

## 1. Core values

In priority order. When two values conflict, the higher one wins.

1. **If it compiles, whole classes of bugs cannot happen.** No null or nil, no unchecked access to optional values, no exceptions, no non-exhaustive matches, no mutable state (v0.1), and no broken contracts.
2. **Rigor must be cheap.** Declaring a rule should cost about as much as writing an `if`. Haskell-level guarantees without Haskell-level ceremony. If a guarantee is hard to express, that is a language bug.
3. **Explicit escape hatches, never silent bypasses.** Whenever a guarantee is weakened, it is visible in the code, greppable, and reviewable.
4. **Readable at 3am during an incident.** Explicit over clever. One obvious way to do common things.
5. **Boring, fast tooling.** One `bork` binary, fast builds, and a formatter with no options.
6. **Friendly, specific diagnostics.** Errors say what could not be proven, where, and how to fix it.

## Decided

### Language fundamentals

- **Statically typed.**
- **No null, no nil.** The concept does not exist in the language.
- **`Option` is statically checked.** The value inside an `Option` cannot be extracted without first checking that it is present (via `match`, or a guard the compiler understands). There is no `.get()`-style unchecked extraction.
- **No mutable state in v0.1.** Every value is immutable. This is the foundation of the proof model: a fact proven about a value can never be invalidated later, so proofs are never lost to mutation. Opt-in mutable types may come in a later version.
- **Exhaustive matching is enforced.** A `match` that does not cover every case is a compile error. The compiler never inserts an implicit panic for a missing case.

### Errors and failure

- **No exceptions. At all.** There is no `throw`, no `try`/`catch`. Expected failures are values (a `Result`-style type).
- **Panics exist but are discouraged.** A panic means a bug, not an expected failure.
- **No `recover`.** A panic cannot be caught in bork code. Erlang-style isolation of routines (a failing routine brought down without taking the rest with it) may be introduced later.

### Effects and concurrency

- **Side effects are allowed.** Reading and writing files, sockets, and so on are ordinary operations.
- **No effect or state monads.** No `IO`, `State`, or time monads. Concurrency uses Go's goroutines (virtual threads), so sequential blocking code is the norm, and there is no need to thread effects through types.

### Compilation target and Go

- **Compiles to Go.** Go is purely a compilation target, chosen so bork gets Go's runtime, GC, goroutine scheduler, and cross-platform compilation without building its own backend.
- **No access to Go's standard library or Go packages from bork code.** bork code never calls Go directly. bork has its own standard library. The Go code the compiler generates, and the bork standard library's implementation, can freely use Go's standard library under the hood. That is an implementation detail, invisible to bork programs.
- **No FFI in v0.1.** Calling into Go (or anything else) from bork may come later, as an explicit boundary.

### General

- **Strict evaluation**, not lazy. Laziness makes memory and performance hard to reason about in backend systems.
- **A short error-propagation operator** (like Rust's `?`) so `Result` handling stays cheap. Exact syntax to be settled with errors and effects.
- **No user-defined symbolic operators** (e.g. `|+|`, `>>=`).
- **No hidden resolution magic.** Type class instances are resolved implicitly, but only from an explicitly imported, bounded set of places (see type classes below). Nothing like Scala 2's implicit conversions or whole-program implicit search.
- **Performance target:** roughly Go-level performance, traded away for guarantees where needed.

## 2. Type system

### Decided

- **Records and sum types (ADTs) are the core data types.** Records are product types. Sum types are tagged unions whose variants can carry data.
- **Generics in v0.1.** User code can declare generic types and functions, not just use built-in ones like `Option[T]` and `Result[T, E]`.
- **Variance: planned, not in v0.1.** Scala-style declaration-site variance controls (covariant and contravariant type parameters) are planned for a later version. The syntax should leave room for them.
- **Structural typing for interfaces and constraints.** A type satisfies an interface or generic constraint implicitly, by having the required shape (like Go). No `implements` declarations.
- **Sealed types and traits are opt-in.** Marking a type sealed closes its set of variants to its own declaration. That is what makes exhaustive matching possible without a default case. Matching on an open (unsealed) type always needs a default case.
- **Immutable persistent collections** in the standard library: `List`, `Map`, `Set`.
- **Pragmatic local type inference, like Go and Scala.** Function signatures are written out, which doubles as documentation, and local values are inferred.
- **Scala-style inline lambdas.** Lambda parameter types are inferred from the expected type at the call site, so `users.map(u => u.name)` needs no annotations.

### Type classes

- **Type classes are first-class.** They attach behaviour to a *type*, not just to values of it: type-level operations like `empty`, `decode`, `parse`, or `default` that need no value to call them on.
- **Instances can be declared for constrained types.** For example, `instance Decode[Int where positive]` decodes an `Int` and proves `positive` in one step, so a request type with refined fields decodes into already-proven values.
- **More than one instance per (class, type) may exist.** For example, several JSON encodings or orderings of the same type.
- **The instance search space is explicit.** Instances are looked up only in explicitly imported instance scopes, never by scanning the whole program. Which instance applies is determined by what the file imports.
- **Both structural interfaces and type classes exist**, as different tools for different situations. Structural interfaces describe what a value can do. Type classes attach behaviour to a type, including types you don't own.
- **No automatic default instances.** The compiler never picks up an instance on its own, not even one declared next to the type or the type class. A library may expose a default set of instances, but it must still be imported explicitly. This is an experiment: we'll try it and see how it feels in practice.
- **Ambiguous instances are a compile error.** If more than one in-scope instance matches, including several instances for constrained types that a value satisfies, the build fails.
- **Automatic derivation in v0.1:** `derive Eq, Show, Decode` (and similar) for records and ADTs.
- **Higher-kinded types (`Functor[List]`): room in the syntax, not implemented in v0.1.**
- **No circular package dependencies**, as in Go. This keeps instance lookup, and compilation in general, bounded and predictable.

Sketch (syntax not final):

```
typeclass Monoid[T] {
  fn empty: T
  fn combine(a: T, b: T): T
}

fn sum[T: Monoid](xs: List[T]): T = xs.fold(Monoid[T].empty, Monoid[T].combine)
```

### Open questions

- Scala-style placeholder shorthand for lambdas (e.g. `_.name`), or always named parameters?
- Can a sealed type's variants be spread over several files in one package, or must they sit in one declaration?
- How is an instance passed explicitly at a call site, when narrowing imports is not enough (e.g. `xs.sorted(using byName)`)?
- Instance-dependent collections: a `Set` or `Map` built with one ordering or hash instance could later be used with a different one, and would then silently misbehave. Should collections capture their instance when they are built, so that cannot happen?

## 3. Contracts and knowledge (in progress)

> Nothing in this section is decided yet. The examples show the direction; the syntax is a sketch.

### Constrained inputs: examples

Parameters carry their requirements in the signature. One parameter per line, with trailing commas, so the formatter can align columns and diffs stay small.

```
fn transfer(
  from:   AccountId,
  to:     AccountId where notEqual(from),
  amount: Money where positive and below(10_000),
  note:   Option[String where nonEmpty and maxLen(280)],
): Result[Receipt, TransferError] = {
  ...
}
```

Note that the constraint on `note` applies inside the `Option`. The note may be absent, but if it is present, it is non-empty and at most 280 characters.

Named constrained types keep signatures short and give domain concepts a name:

```
type Port     = Int where between(1, 65535)
type Email    = String where validEmail
type UserName = String where nonEmpty and maxLen(100)

fn connect(
  host: String where nonEmpty,
  port: Port,
): Result[Conn, ConnectError]
```

Records with constrained fields, derived decoding, and knowledge that arrives at the boundary:

```
type CreateUser = {
  name:  UserName,
  email: Email,
  age:   Option[Int where between(0, 150)],
} derive (Decode)

fn handleCreate(body: Json): Result[User, ApiError] = {
  req = CreateUser.decode(body)?      // every field is proven here, once
  createUser(req)                     // no re-validation downstream
}
```

Postconditions: a function's return type can promise facts too.

```
fn clamp(
  x:  Int,
  lo: Int,
  hi: Int where atLeast(lo),
): Int where between(lo, hi) = ...
```

Generic functions that *add* knowledge (the long-term goal; needs predicates usable in type signatures):

```
fn filter[T](xs: List[T], p: Pred[T]): List[T where p]

positives = numbers.filter(positive)   // List[Int where positive]
```

### Syntax notes

- **`name: Type` with a colon** is the working assumption. Once constraints are attached, types become phrases (`Money where positive and below(10_000)`), and the colon keeps the name clearly apart from the type. It also matches Scala-style lambdas: `(u: User) => u.name`.
  The Go-style alternative, `amount Money where positive`, reads well in short signatures but gets harder to scan as constraints grow.
- **`and` combines predicates**, because a comma would clash with the comma between parameters.
- **Predicates can take arguments** (`maxLen(280)`, `between(1, 65535)`), including other parameters (`notEqual(from)`, `atLeast(lo)`), which is how relations between values are expressed.

### Compile-time evaluation

bork needs compile-time evaluation, in the spirit of [q's `AtCompileTime`](https://github.com/GiGurra/q) and proven's literal checks, to infer that types and constraints are satisfied:

- **Predicates on compile-time-known values are evaluated during compilation.** `connect("db", 5432)` is accepted because `between(1, 65535)(5432)` is computed at build time. `connect("db", 0)` fails the build. Unlike proven, this works for *any* predicate, not just a built-in set.
- **Constants and named constrained values.** `defaultPort: Port = 8080` is checked once, when compiled.
- **Explicit compile-time computation** of lookup tables, constants, and derived data, marked at the call site (as q does), with the result baked into the binary.
- **Compile-time code should only read files inside the module.** This is a convention, not enforced in v0.1 (see purity below).

### Facts, purity, and the outside world

- **No purity tracking in v0.1.** Immutability by design already covers concurrency and the stability of values. The compiler does not check that predicates are free of side effects (database or file I/O, the clock, randomness).
- **Predicates are expected to be deterministic, but this is not checked.** A predicate whose answer can change for the same value (e.g. `isOpenNow(store)`, which reads the clock) produces facts that can go stale. That is a bug in the program, not something the compiler catches. The convention is: **effects produce values, and facts are about values.** For example, read `now = clock.now()` once, then use `isOpenAt(store, now)`.
- **Facts about outside systems are facts about a point in time.** A fact can describe the outside world (a row exists, a file is present), but it is true as of when it was established. Keeping that current is the developer's job, not the compiler's. bork is aimed at typical web backend services, where a request reads its inputs, decides, and writes within a short window. Treating what it loaded as a fixed snapshot is the right model there. Concurrent changes elsewhere are handled with the usual backend tools (transactions, idempotency, optimistic locking), not by the proof system.
- **Compile-time evaluation runs whatever a predicate does.** Without purity tracking, a predicate that does I/O will do it at build time when evaluated on a literal. A purity check limited to code reachable from predicates and compile-time blocks can be added later without affecting ordinary code.
- **No widening syntax.** Facts are forgotten simply by passing a value where a less constrained type is expected (`Int where positive` to an `Int` parameter). No `x as Int` is needed.

### Open questions

- **Colon or no colon** in parameter lists: `amount: Money` or `amount Money`?
- **Function keyword:** `fn`, `func`, or `def`? The examples use `fn` for now. `def` is ambiguous (define *what*?), `func` is familiar from Go, and `fn` is the shortest and reads well in long signatures.
- **Inline predicates:** only named predicates (`positive`), or also inline expressions (`where it > 0`)? Inline expressions require the compiler to recognise equivalent expressions.
- **Exported return types:** do callers see only the facts a signature declares, or also facts the compiler derives from the body? A proposal: exported functions expose only the declared facts (the signature is the contract), and private functions may expose derived ones.

## Resources and scopes

Outside resources (files, sockets, database connections, transactions, locks) are the one place where "facts only grow" is under pressure: the handle value never changes, but closing it changes the world it refers to. bork handles this with scopes, in the style of ZIO, so the open state can never end while a resource is still reachable.

### Decided (v0.1)

- **Resources belong to scopes.** Opening a resource requires a scope. A resource can be attached to one or more scopes, and it is **closed when the last of them closes**. There is no manual `close`, so there is neither use-after-close nor forgot-to-close.
- **Scopes are blocks.** `scope s { ... }` opens a scope, which closes when the block ends. Finalizers run in reverse order of acquisition (LIFO), like Go's `defer`.
- **Scope values can be passed down, never escape.** A scope can be passed as a function argument, but it cannot be returned, stored in a record, or captured by anything that outlives it.
- **A resource cannot outlive all of its scopes.** Which scopes a resource is attached to is itself a fact, and `attach` adds a fact, so this fits the core idea of only-growing knowledge.
- **Reference counting falls out of the design.** Within one call stack, scopes nest, so the last scope is simply the outermost one. Across goroutines, a resource attached to several scopes stays open until all of them have closed, which is shared ownership without a separate `shared_ptr`-style type.
- **Scopes are passed explicitly in v0.1.** Acquiring functions take the scope as an ordinary argument. Implicit scope passing may be added later.

```
fn main() = scope app {
  pool = openDbPool(cfg, app)?             // lives as long as the app
  serve(pool, app)
}

fn handle(req: Request, pool: DbPool) = scope request {
  conn = pool.connect(request)?            // closed when the request scope ends
  file = openFile(path, request)?
  ...
}                                          // finalizers run LIFO

scope job {
  conn = db.connect(job)?
  go worker(conn)                          // conn stays open until job and worker are both done
}

fn worker(conn: Conn) = scope w {
  conn.attach(w)
  ...
}
```

### To settle with concurrency

- **Cancellation and deadlines through scopes.** A request scope is the natural carrier for what Go's `context.Context` does today: when a request is cancelled, its scope closes, its resources are released, and its goroutines stop.
- **Structured concurrency:** must goroutines started inside a scope finish before the scope ends? That would let them use the scope's resources with no extra attaching.

## Open questions

- Should "rigor must be cheap" rank above "if it compiles, bugs cannot happen", meaning a guarantee is dropped if it cannot be made cheap?
- Limited operator overloading (e.g. `+` for money or vector types), or none at all?
- Other principles to adopt: strong backwards-compatibility promises? No macros?

## Topics still to discuss
